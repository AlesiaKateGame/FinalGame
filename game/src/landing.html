                        <h2>MEET THE AUTHORS </h2>
                        Krim Maaloul was born in the southern suburbs of Tunis.
                        He spent his childhood surrounded by sheep blocking the streets,
                        and goat thieving flowers from gardens. Local wildlife quickly became 
                        an inexhaustible source of inspiration.
                        Later, he studied illustration and comics in Brussels.
                        After two publications: Elephant's Memory (published by
                        Les éditions du Pépin) and The story of the day and night
                        (published by Lo Pais d'enfance), he turned to the enigmatic
                        world of computers and the Internet.

                        In 2009, he became one of the co-founders of Epic, a Belgian creative agency specializing in the creation 
                        of digital content and where he is now in charge of design and flash development.
                        For Babel, he uses the various skills acquired throughout his career. He creates a 
                        fascinating and educational story which will entertain the younger children and captivate the older.
